üéÆ Free Games Watcher (Discord Bot)

Announces games temporarily discounted to free on Epic Games Store and Steam, and lists what‚Äôs free right now ‚Äî excluding titles that are always free. Region‚Äëaware, channel‚Äëconfigurable, owner/admin‚Äëonly controls. Built with discord.py + SQLite.

‚ú® Features

- üîî Announcements: Posts new freebies to a channel you choose
- üÜì Paid ‚Üí Free only: Filters out permanently free titles
- üåç Region aware: Per‚Äëguild country code (e.g., US, GB, DE)
- üõ°Ô∏è Owner/Admin only: Settings restricted to trusted users
- üíæ Lightweight storage: SQLite de‚Äëdupes and persists deals
- ‚è±Ô∏è Polling: Periodic fetch of Epic + Steam feeds

üß© Slash Commands

- `/freelist` ‚Äî Show currently free paid games in your configured region
- `/freelist_region [code]` ‚Äî Set or view the region (owner/admin; ISO 3166‚Äë1 alpha‚Äë2)
- `/freelist_channel #channel` ‚Äî Set the announcement channel (owner/admin)
- `/freelist_poll_now` ‚Äî Force a fetch + announce now (owner/admin)
- `/freelist_debug` ‚Äî Show fetch diagnostics (owner/admin)

üß† How It Detects Freebies

- Epic Games Store: Active promo window flagged in the feed; counts a title as free when the promo is live and the original price was > $0 (Epic often reports `discountPercentage: 0` during free weeks; we rely on the promo window, not listed price).
- Steam: Confirms via appdetails that it‚Äôs a game, not permanently free (`is_free == false`), and that `price_overview.final == 0` with a positive original price.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup

- Requirements: Python 3.13+ and a Discord bot token
- Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Configure env: copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then set `DISCORD_TOKEN` and optionally `POLL_MINUTES`
- Run: `python bot.py`
- First‚Äëtime in your server (owner/admin): `/freelist_region code: US`, `/freelist_channel channel: #your-channel`, then `/freelist`

üì¶ Environment (.env)

- The bot auto‚Äëloads `.env` via `python-dotenv`.
- Example:
  - `DISCORD_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN`
  - `POLL_MINUTES=30`

üêç Python Version

- Recommended: Python 3.13+ (requirements include the necessary backport for clean installs).

üîó Invite URL

Use this URL to invite your bot. Replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your application‚Äôs ID from the Discord Developer Portal (General Information page). Do not use your bot token here.

`https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_APP_ID&scope=bot%20applications.commands&permissions=84992`

- `client_id`: your Application ID (a numeric ID), not the token.
- `scope`: keeps slash commands and bot permissions.
- `permissions=84992`: View Channels (1024) + Send Messages (2048) + Embed Links (16384) + Read Message History (65536). Adjust if you need more.

üê≥ Docker (Optional)

Use this Dockerfile:

```
FROM python:3.13-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
CMD ["python", "bot.py"]
```

Build & run:

```
docker build -t free-bot .
docker run --env-file .env --name free-bot free-bot
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- Data is stored in `free_deals.sqlite3` in the repo directory.
- The poller runs every `POLL_MINUTES` minutes (set in env).
- Steam ‚Äúfree to keep‚Äù promos are rarer than Epic‚Äôs weekly freebies; zero results for Steam can be normal.

üôã Troubleshooting

- Commands not showing? Global slash commands can take minutes to appear after first sync. If needed, re‚Äëinvite or restart the bot.
- ‚ÄúMessage content intent missing‚Äù warning is safe to ignore (this bot uses slash commands).
- Seeing no freebies? Try `/freelist_debug` to confirm feed counts and sample titles. Epic weekends vary and Steam promos are sporadic.
